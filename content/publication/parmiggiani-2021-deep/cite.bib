 abstract = {The follow-up of external science alerts received from gamma-ray burst (GRB) and gravitational wave detectors is one of the AGILE Team’s current major activities. The AGILE team developed an automated real-time analysis pipeline to analyze AGILE Gamma-Ray Imaging Detector (GRID) data to detect possible counterparts in the energy range 0.1–10 GeV. This work presents a new approach for detecting GRBs using a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify the AGILE-GRID intensity maps by improving the GRB detection capability over the Li &amp; Ma method, currently used by the AGILE team. The CNN is trained with large simulated data sets of intensity maps. The AGILE complex observing pattern due to the so-called “spinning mode” is studied to prepare data sets to test and evaluate the CNN. A GRB emission model is defined from the second Fermi-LAT GRB catalog and convoluted with the AGILE observing pattern. Different p-value distributions are calculated, evaluating, using the CNN, millions of background-only maps simulated by varying the background level. The CNN is then used on real data to analyze the AGILE-GRID data archive, searching for GRB detections using the trigger time and position taken from the Swift-BAT, Fermi-GBM, and Fermi-LAT GRB catalogs. From these catalogs, the CNN detects 21 GRBs with a significance of ≥3σ, while the Li &amp; Ma method detects only two GRBs. The results shown in this work demonstrate that the CNN is more effective in detecting GRBs than the Li &amp; Ma method in this context and can be implemented into the AGILE-GRID real-time analysis pipeline.},
