I am Senior Researcher at the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI). My primary research objective revolves around exploring the benefits of quantum algorithms for computationally hard problems in artificial intelligence. In addition to my research endeavors, I am the lecturer of the quantum artificial intelligence courses at Saarland University.
